# Holy-Desk-Clock

First GitHub project to create a web desktop clock with features for a nice aesthetic screensaver. 
Will add additional features in the future but this is it for now.

Oh by the way, due to security reasons the weather won't work coz it's missing the API Key from Open Weather Map. You can make your own for free and add it to the variable on the script and it should work.

Watch this space :).
